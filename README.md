*&copy; 2021*

The purpose of this image gallery is to showcase my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript so far!

The Images are all placed as objects in the images array, with one forEach loop creating and populating all the HTML elements. The forEach loop starting on line 99. 

All images have been sourced from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).
